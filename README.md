Abstract:
In this paper we present similarity based TOPSIS
with OWA operators. The motivation behind this new method is
the fact that in many real world problems it is more important
to consider the amount of criteria that a particular alternative is
able to satisfy instead of simply concentrating on the importance
of particular criteria. Here with OWA operators we can tackle
this problem together with multi-criteria decision making method
called TOPSIS by aggregating alternatives’ similarities towards
positive ideal solution and negative ideal solution and aggregating
these similarities using OWA. The use of linguistic quantifiers
represented by OWA weights generated by a selected RIM
quantifier allows for the reflection of decision-maker’s attitude to
risk in the calculation of the similarities of the alternative with
positive and negative ideal solutions.
